This project contains a prototype of how the message is secretly transferred between two parties using quantum cryptography.
The interruption of third parties can be easily found with the change of qbits.
Qutanum cryptography is the recently emerging topic.
More over the famous quantum computers use quantum mechanical phenomenon for its functioning.
For running this project, run app.py file.
The project is deployed as a website using flask framework.
